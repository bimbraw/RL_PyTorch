# RL_PyTorch
In the final project, our team wanted to learn more about applying reinforcement learning to physical systems. We were curious about the OpenAI Gymnasium toolkit for simulations and the recently developed Deep Q-Network algorithm (2015) which we did not study in detail in our graduate artificial intelligence class. To achieve these goals, we tackled the Cart-Pole-v1 simulation provided in OpenAI Gym. The objective of the Cart-Pole simulation is to keep a vertical pole on a rolling cart from falling over.
